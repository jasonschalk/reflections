When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to have a remote repository if I'm working with others on a project or if I wanted a backup of my work on a different server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
If it automatically pulled changes it might involve a merge which would be annoying.  The changes might 
interfere with what is currently being worked on locally.
